# Data1030 Project-- Breast Cancer Wisconsin 
This repository includes everything of the DATA 1030 project. 

Forecasting breast cancer can significantly increase the survival rate of patients, and classifying the sample tumor cells as malignant or benign is one of the best and most direct ways to make accurate predictions. 


This project takes Breast Cancer Wisconsin as the data set to explore different machine learning algorithms by analyzing their accuracy and sensitivity. The dataset was obtained from UCI machine learning Repository(https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php). The features are the cytological features obtained by Fine Needle Aspirations. The target variable is the diagnosis of the tumor cell type, being malignant or benign. 


Enlightened by previous studies, this study uses Lasso logistic Regression, random forest, boosting algorithms, support vector machine classifier and Naive Bayes as the machine learning algorithms.
